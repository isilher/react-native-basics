# React Native Basics

Let’s meet on a weekly basis and go over the basics of React Native!

## What will we do

During the meeting I will go over the basics of React Native. It’s going to be an interactive lesson: no slides or presentation but I’ll ask you all some questions about your experience and share some information based on that. I would advise everyone to spend a little time on a pet project to put the lesson into practice, but we’ll also talk about that in the first meeting.

## What can you prepare

To get up to speed quickly, you can go ahead and set up Expo on your local machine. See https://expo.io for instructions.
Meanwhile, think of a (small scope) project to work on individually. For example: an app to keep score during a game or to consume a public API. Don’t make it too technically complex (no AI, no custom backend dependency etc).
